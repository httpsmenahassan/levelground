# How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS

I started by creating a basic box outline for the page. From there, I added images and text. This website is responsive meaning that if you change the size of the window you're browsing in, the content of the page will adjust the better fit the new window size. This was accomplished using media queries in CSS.

# Lessons Learned:
I had fun playing around with the different window sizes when creating media queries.
